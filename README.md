The function of this app is to assist a waiter in taking orders in a resturant setting. 

This app has a splash screen activity which leads to the main activity. The main activity consists of 
a Recycler View, within the Recycler View links to the various activities within the app. Activities
such as. Create Order, View Orders, Make Notes, Menu Selection, Table Selection.

This application can read and write to a SQLite database. This app provides a the ability
to add to the database through editText wigits in the NewOrder activity. These orders are saved 
within the databased and can be viewed in the ViewOrders activity through a Recycler View.
Each order can be deleted from the ViewOrder activity prompting a warning dialogue.

An agile UX approach was taken. Beautiful graphics with a simple interface.
